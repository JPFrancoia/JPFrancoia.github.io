During my Ph. D, I developed a software to keep up-to-date with the
scientific literature (you can learn more about it by visiting [ChemBrows'
About page](http://www.chembrows.com/website/index.php?static3/about) or by
reading [our paper](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jchemed.6b00024).  

The first commit is as old as 16th October 2014. Even with my new PostDoc
position, I never ceased to work on this software that is my pride. With
the help of Laurent Vial and all our users, ChemBrows finally reached a
state we judge perfectly stable, after more than three years of development.
Here are a few statistics about ChemBrows as of today (24/12/2017).
