# A usable, homemade weather station 

In this article I will detail how I built a simple weather station from
scratch. This station measures the humidity, temperature, pressure and
luminosity inside my flat and displays them on a small screen. It also
sends these measurements to a MQTT server via wifi. I can then access all
these metrics from my Home Assistant server. The station is powered with
a micro-USB cable.

## Background

I've been playing with microelectronics for a while, but recently I decided
to push a project until the very end. I decided to make a mini weather station
"from scratch". We could argue on what "from scratch" means, but since I'm
a beginner with microelectronics, I allowed myself to use a pre assembled
ESP32 dev kit board, and sensors mounted on breakout boards. Everything
was soldered on a perfboard. I designed and 3D printed the enclosure.

There was probably much better ways to build this weather station. Please
feel free to contact me to tell me how I could have built it better. I
just wanted to get it *to work*, even if it's not perfect (and preferably
without burning down my house).


## Components

Here are the components I used:

- [Light sensor](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B07VL6G73X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) 
- [Temperature, pressure, humidity sensor](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B07D8T4HP6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- [TFT screen](https://www.tinytronics.nl/shop/nl/display/tft/2.2-inch-tft-display-240*320-pixels-ili9341)
- [ESP32 dev kit board](https://www.banggood.com/30Pin-ESP32-Development-Board-WiFibluetooth-Ultra-Low-Power-Consumption-Dual-Cores-ESP-32-ESP-32S-Board-p-1461896.html?rmmds=myorder&cur_warehouse=CN)
- 5x7 cm perfboard

The ESP32 dev kit is the main component of the circuitry: it has wifi (and
bluetooth) capabilities and it will perform all the logic of the weather
station. It will trigger measurements from the sensors, wake up the screen,
send the data to the MQTT server, etc. The two sensors I used are I2C sensors.


## Wiring

I failed several times while mounting all the components on the perfboard. 
It needed to meet the following criteria:

- The assembly needed to take as little space as possible
- The light sensor needed to be located at the top of the assembly (to properly measure the
ambiant light)
- The temperature sensor needed to be as far away as possible from the main
board (the main board heats up when wifi is ON)
- The TFT screen is mounted on the front face of the enclosure, but is
connected on the perfboard. The tension on the wires needed to be minimal.
- The micro USB port of the ESP32 needed to be available, to power the station

Ultimately I ended up with the (ugly) assembly below:

</p>

I used some hot glue to relieve the tension on the wires at the soldering
points. Without this the wires would often break, making manipulation of
the whole assembly tedious. It's not pretty, and from what I read the hot
glue might start detaching in a few months, but for now the whole thing is
robust enough.

## Design of the enclosure

I wanted to use a FOSS software to design the enclosure so I used FreeCAD. It
doesn't really compare to Onshape or SolidWorks (yet?) but it was good enough
for the job, especially since the design of the enclosure was quite simple.

You can find the FreeCAD files here: [front]({{ site.baseurl }}/attached/weather_station_front.FCStd); [back]({{ site.baseurl }}/attached/weather_station_front.FCStd)  
And the STL files (for 3D printing) are here: [front]({{ site.baseurl }}/attached/weather_station_front.stl); [back]({{ site.baseurl }}/attached/weather_station_front.stl)

It took me 4-5 iterations to get the sensors perfectly aligned with the
openings on the sides of the enclosure.


## Code and routers

I used Micropython to implement all the logic. I use Python every day at
work and it was simply the best choice to get this project done. Of course
this was only possible because the ESP32 is really a beast (compared to
an Arduino UNO for example). Micropython requires 256Kb of RAM to run. The
ESP32 has 520 KB of SRAM. In comparison, an Arduino UNO only has 2 KB.

You can find the full code here: [https://github.com/JPFrancoia/esp32_devkit_weather_station]("https://github.com/JPFrancoia/esp32_devkit_weather_station")

Implementing the logic of the weather station seemed simple at first, but I had
a lot of reliability issues:

- Sometimes the hardware (e.g: the sensors) wouldn't answer, because of a
    faulty wiring or because the measurement frequency was too high
- Sometimes the station couldn't connect to the network
- Sometimes the messages sent to the MQTT server would never arrive

Solving the hardware issues was straightforward: better soldering of the
components and less frequent measurements. Solving the network issues
proved to be harder. It turns out the wifi antenna on this kind of board
isn't really good (for a board costing less than 10â‚¬, no surprise...). So
instead of letting the station communicate directly with my main router,
I turned a Raspberry pi 4 that I had in a drawer into a network bridge. I
plugged a wifi dongle into the Pi to give it an additional wifi interface
(the Raspberry pi models 3 and 4 already have an internal wifi chip). Then
I created a small network on one wifi interface so that the weather station
could communicate with the Pi. This small network is isolated from the
Internet. The station sends its data to the Pi via this small network, but
the Pi is connected directly to my main router via its other wifi interface
(coming from its internal wifi chip).

The MQTT server lives on the Raspberry Pi, as well as the Home Assistant
server. Ultimately, the Pi acts as a node: sensors on the small wifi network
can send data to it, and I can connect to the Pi via my main wifi network,
to access the Home assistant server and see the measurements:

## What I tried but didn't work

At first I wanted to display the information sent by the sensors on an e-ink
screen. I was able to display some numbers on the screen, but the e-ink screen
drivers weren't well supported and I couldn't get the screen to work reliably.
This is a shame because this kind of screen doesn't need a backlight to be
read, while a TFT screen does. But the TFT screen is half cheaper.
