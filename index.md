# About me

<p align="justify">
After obtaining my PhD in 2016, I moved to Glasgow to join the group
of <a href="http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/cronin">Prof. Lee Cronin</a> as a
postdoctoral research associate. I was part of the "reactionware" team,
which aims to digitize organic chemistry through, for example, 3D printed
reactors.

In 2018, I decided to leave academia to join Okra Technologies, a dynamic
start-up, as a data engineer. As OKRANs, we are building artificial
intelligence analytics engine for healthcare, and we hope to improve human
lives. My curiosity, open mind and coding skills (I code as a hobby!) made
me a perfect fit for this very special company.
