<p align="justify">

After obtaining my PhD in <b>2016</b>, I moved to Glasgow to join the group
of <a href="http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/cronin">Prof. Lee Cronin</a> as a
postdoctoral research associate. I was part of the "reactionware" team,
which aims to digitize organic chemistry through, for example, 3D printed
reactors.

</p>

<p align="justify">

In <b>2018</b>, I decided to leave academia to join <a
href="https://www.okra.ai/">Okra Technologies</a>, a dynamic healthcare
start-up, as a data engineer. There, I built analytics engines for healthcare
companies. My main responsibilities were the development of backend services
and the development of Okra's data lake. <span style="color: #C6C6C6;">In 2023,
Okra was acquired by Envision Pharma.</span>

</p>

<p align="justify">

In <b>2021</b>, I joined <a href="https://www.babylonhealth.com/en-gb">Babylon
Health</a> as a Software Engineer. I was ensuring the high availability and
quality of medical data to improve the output of Babylon's AI models. I was
also working on a set of microservices to validate the safety of these
models. Once these models were considered safe - any healthcare environment
is extremely regulated! - I deployed these models into production, where they
would help improve the health of our patients.<br/>

</p>

<p align="justify">

In <b>2022</b>, I joined Babylon's <b>Site Reliability Engineering</b>
(SRE) team, as a senior software engineer. My responsibilities ranged
from being on-call 24/7 to respond to incidents, to maintaining Babylon's
infrastructure. I also helped developers scale their applications and make
sure they worked reliably in production.

</p>

<p align="justify">

In <b>2023</b>, I left the healthcare field behind to join the Telco world:
I joined <a href="https://news.virginmediao2.co.uk/">Virgin Media O2</a>. I'm
still a software engineer, and I'm now leading a team tasked with creating
a "fault platform". This platform aims to detect and remediate faults on
VMO2's network.
